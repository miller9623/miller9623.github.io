											<h3>What is College Mentors for Kids at Virginia Tech all about?</h3>
											<p>By being involved in College Mentors for Kids, each mentor is able to guide their men-tee, also
												 known as their “little buddy”, to
												understand the importance of education by encouraging them to reach their full
												potential, and to show them the importance of giving back to their community. Almost everyone
												has had some kind of mentor
												in their life that made a difference. Whether it be a family member, coach, youth
												volunteer, teacher, etc. there was someone who made a permanent impression.
												College Mentors for Kids is a non-profit organization that provides you with the chance to
												be that role model. Being a mentor is a way for us
												college students to get connected with each other, as well as the
												community around us. While being a mentor you can learn about different resources
												 offered on campus, responsibility and leadership needed to be a positive role
												 model, and how to put Virginia Tech’s motto into action: Ut Prosim — that I may serve!

											<h3>The Value of Being a Part of College Mentors for Kids!</h3>
											<p>As a mentor, I realized how much I had gotten out of College Mentors for Kids.
												 I would tell my parents about the different activity days. That Ellie
												seemed to really enjoy the program and that she liked hanging
												 out with me every week. I realized that College Mentors for Kids was not only impacting
												 Ellie’s life, but my life as well. I recognized the value of this program; that College
												 Mentors for Kids not only gets kids involved in school and education, but that it also
												 creates meaningful relationships between the mentors and the little buddies. By being a part
												 of College Mentors for Kids, I was more involved with things around campus. I knew that no
												 matter how stressful my week was I always had something to look forward to that would brighten
												 up my week. Not only did I have something exciting to do every week, but I became more dependable because
												 I wanted to be there for my little buddy.</p>

											<p> Looking back on my experience with College Mentors for Kids, I realized how much of an influence this
											 organization had been. Who would have guessed that spending two hours a week with someone could turn
											 into such a memorable part of my life. Being in my Junior year of college, when people ask me what are
											 some of my favorite memories so far I usually say going square dancing — something that is completely out
											 of character for me, but a great experience — or going to Virginia Tech football games and jumping to “Enter
											 Sandman”, or even going hiking and taking pictures of some spectacular views with friends, but one thing that
											I will always remember is being a part of College Mentors for Kids! This experience has been an amazing
											one; an experience that has changed me for the better!</p>

															<p>Prior to College Mentors for Kids, I wasn't really confident in myself. I didn't know
															where I would find my place to fit in here at Virginia Tech, but I heard about
														this great organization and it sounded like something I could get really excited about and
													that is exactly what it has turned into! I love everything about this organization. From the Mentors
												and the kids, to all of the executive staff and everybody behind the scenes -- everybody -- has made
											Virginia Tech feel like home to me, and I really feel like I found <strong> my people </strong>. </p>

															<p>No matter what kind of week you were having, if you had a test the day before or if
																you hadn't slept, showing up and helping with the activities, showing them around Virginia Tech,
																 letting them see a little of your own life, made it easier to get through the second
																 half of the week. Knowing that I was impacting someone else's life; someone who now saw
																 college in a different light because of the example I was to them helped me to want to
																 push myself to be the best <strong> me </strong> that I can be!</p>
